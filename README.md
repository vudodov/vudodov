ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

My name is Val.
Iâ€™m a hands-on architect, full-stack software engineer.

Big fan and adopter of domain-driven design.
Event-driven architecture evangelist.
Iâ€™m a strong supporter of the re-factoring as a routine approach.
Iâ€™m not too big on any particular technology, however I do spend most of the time with C#, JavaScript, F#, GoLang and all bells and whistles around it.

I love to be engaged in the full software development cycle. From collaboration and planning and white-boarding, all the way to the release, feedback, re-factoring.

Iâ€™m always open for a chat, so shoot me an email ;)
