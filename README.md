ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

My name is Val.
Iâ€™m a hands-on architect and full-stack software engineer. 
I also blog occasionally -> [Tech Blog](https://valerii-udodov.com/)

Big fan and adopter of domain-driven design.
Event-driven architecture evangelist.
Iâ€™m a strong supporter of re-factoring as a routine approach.
Iâ€™m not too big on any particular technology.

I love to be engaged in the full software development cycle. From discovery/inception phase, through the white-boarding and planning, all the way to the release, feedback and re-factoring.

Iâ€™m always open for a chat, so shoot me an email ;)
