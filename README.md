ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

My name is Val.
Iâ€™m a full-stack software engineer. 
Iâ€™m a strong supporter of re-factoring as a routine approach.
I love to be engaged in the full software development cycle. From discovery/inception phase, through the white-boarding and planning, all the way to the release, feedback and re-factoring.


I also blog occasionally -> [Tech Blog](https://valerii-udodov.com/)
